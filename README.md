# pta_tutorial
A PTA data analysis tutorial using enterprise, created for GWPAW 2018. This tutorial uses a single pulsar to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background, using data from the NANOGrav 11-year data set.

The Jupyter notebook can be run from Google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19NjbtMmM7YorXKOb2HZnd_g95WN4_X4h. You will need to make a copy of the notebook and save it to your own Google drive. The notebook uses data stored in this repository.
